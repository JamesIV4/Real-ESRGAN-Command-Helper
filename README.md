# Real-ESRGAN-Command-Helper

This tool will quickly configure the command you should paste into your terminal to run Real-ESRGAN.

Put "Upscale-GUI.html" in the repo folder for Real-ESRGAN. Put your input images in the "inputs" folder, and they will by default be generated into the "output" folder.

This makes interacting with Real-ESRGAN a little easier.
